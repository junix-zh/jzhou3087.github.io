Hello, world.

I am a third year at the University of California, Berkeley studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, and Rhetoric. Sometimes a teacher, but always a student. Looking for challenging problems that have strong implications for a thriving future: that learning the technical aspects of a problem will educate and enlighten a global view that is less dystopian as depicted by mass media. I hope to design for the future, and engineer for the present.

Other interests include music production, critical theory, photography, and debate. Although I've spent a considerable amount of time in my youth, still striving to retain a positive outlook on fleeting time, playing games but now have shifted my recreational enjoyment towards other interpretive mediums. Film, music, and photographs are all distortions of reality that showcase the fictional retellings that sometimes convey more truthful nuance than reality. It is within that interpretive dimension that I find meaning and value. While I architect design problems and engineer algorithms, the beauty of such artistic bodies gives me creativity. That is where I hope my career heads toward: a novel integration of novelty and genuity.
