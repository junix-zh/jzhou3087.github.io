Hello, world.

I am a rising third year at the University of California, Berkeley studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, and Rhetoric. Sometimes a teacher, but always a student. Looking for challenging problems that have strong implications for a thriving future: that learning the technical aspects of a problem will educate and enlighten a global view that is less dystopian as depicted by mass media and more revolutionary like virtual reality technologies. Hobbies include music production, critical theory, and debate. I hope to design for the future, and engineer for the present.
