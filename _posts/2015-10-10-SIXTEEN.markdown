Architected a control network feedback system using integrated circuits. 

Functional motion activated by vocal commands that are processed by a stereo mic integrated with a TI MSP430 microcontroller. Through linear regression/least squares, we found appropriate eigenvalues with Singular Value Decomposition and Principal Component Analysis to assign certain motor control parameters that support axis movement. Furthermore, using K-Means, we clustered four different voice commands to support voice activated turns. 

Used C and Python throughout the project.
