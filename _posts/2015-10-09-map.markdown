BearMaps is a web mapping application built using Java Spark as the server framework. 

Hosted on a course server -- did not host on my own Heroku server -- that hosts endpoints which take in parameters, the server responds with an output in JSON.
![Application Structure]({{"/assets/61B/appstruct.png" | absolute_url }})

There are four GET endpoints: /raster, /route, 


The following implementations were used to solve the respective design problems: a quadtree data structure for map rastering with O(k log k + log n) for a map with k tiles intersecting a query box and n tiles total, A* algorithm for map routing, and a trie data structure for autocompletion on a query string with O(k) for a query where k words of maximum length share a prefix s.
